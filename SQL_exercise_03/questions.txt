Select all warehouses.# select * from warehouses;
Select all boxes with a value larger than $150.#select * from boxes where Value>150;
Select all distinct contents in all the boxes.#select distinct contents from boxes;
Select the average value of all the boxes.#select avg(value) from boxes;
Select the warehouse code and the average value of the boxes in each warehouse.#select warehouse, avg(value) from boxes group by warehouse;
Same as previous exercise, but select only those warehouses where the average value of the boxes is greater than 150.#select warehouse, avg(value) from boxes group by warehousehaving avg(value)> 150;
Select the code of each box, along with the name of the city the box is located in.#select boxes.code, warehouses.location from boxes join warehouses on boxes.Warehouse = Warehouses.Code;
Select the warehouse codes, along with the number of boxes in each warehouse. Optionally, take into account that some warehouses are empty (i.e., the box count should show up as zero, instead of omitting the warehouse from the result).#select Warehouse, count(*) from boxes group by warehouse;
Select the codes of all warehouses that are saturated (a warehouse is saturated if the number of boxes in it is larger than the warehouse's capacity).#select Code from warehouses join (select warehouse temp_a, count(*) temp_b from boxes group by warehouse) temp on (warehouses.code = temp.temp_a) where warehouses.Capacity<temp.temp_b;
Select the codes of all the boxes located in Chicago.#select Boxes.code from boxes join Warehouses on boxes.warehouse = warehouses.code where warehouses.location = 'Chicago';
